Our project analyzes the effect of changing certain traffic conditions on the formation of congestion

In order to simulate the traffic, we utilized Monte Carlo simulations to simulate a sense of randomness on the road

We added functionality like the creation of junctions, the widening of roads, etc. to see how they would impact the congestion on the roads
